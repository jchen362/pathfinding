# pathfinding

link to github pages for this project: https://jchen362.github.io/pathfinding/


This project provides a visualizer for the following pathfinding algorithms: DFS, BFS, dijistras.

I had trouble visualizing how these pathfinding algorithms explored each node so I decided to create a visualizer to help me understand better. The explored nodes
are in green while the yellow node displays the path. Numbered nodes are weighted nodes and gray ones are walls.

The controls are as follows (on the website, there is an info icon with the same information):

Set start position: press s and click on desired position
Set end posiiton: press e and click on desired position
Add walls: click and drag
Add weighted walls: select 1-9 (nodes have default weight of 1), and click and drag
